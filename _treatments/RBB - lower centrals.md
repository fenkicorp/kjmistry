title: DFT - Resin bonded bridge, 6 months later
description: Initially the patient had active localised severe periodontitis on lower centrals. Grade 3 mobile, poor prognosis, non-vital. Patient could not afford implants, was happy having a bridge. Several bridge designs were considered. Due to moderate bone loss on the lower 2's and grade 2 mobility, the design involved also splinting from 3-3 to reduce mobility. The patient underwent periodontal treatment, IDC compliance improved, following lower central extractions, an immediate fit was done.

        An issue that was consented for was that the metal wings would darken the appearance of the abutments especially towards the incisal edges. The patient had no issues throughout the last six months. Note - patient had successfully controlled periodontal condition.
